description: Before releasing mobile application, you should test it in different cases. Here are the methods of it!
---

- [ ] Test the application on stage environment  
We do our tests by using TestFlight on iOS and relevant APK on Android. Download the stage application and start testing now! 

- [ ] Test all the issues that are on Jira for the ongoing sprint  

- [ ] Test the application generally  
In some cases other parts of the application might have been broken, even if there was nothing developed in that parts.

- [ ] Test older version of the application  
So that you can be sure that everything works on older version of the app correctly. 

- [ ] Make sure relevant API version has been deployed to production  

- [ ] Download the new version of the application from store markets  

- [ ] Apply all the tests on production environment
