description: Follow this checklist to not to get lost on the board

- [ ] Navigate to the board settings

- [ ] Check your board name in general settings  
Board names come from the project name. If you gave a meaningful name to your project, board name will be also easy to understand

- [ ] Adjust the column name in the coloumn settings  
Generally we use To Do, In Progress, Code Review, QA, UAT and Done columns

- [ ] Match your columns with the related status  
There should be no unmapped status in the righ-side menu. Otherwise the issues will lost in Jira! 

- [ ] Don't forget to set a swimlane  
Generally we use Stories as swimlane. It is up to the project, you can select the most logical one. 

- [ ] Adjust the card colors based on the priority in card colors settings  
We set red scale for Highest and High, yellow for Medium and green scale for Low and Lowest

- [ ] Set the most used fields in card layout settings  
We use Status, Components, Development and open the days in column indicator
