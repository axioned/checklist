description: As humans, we often act out of routine, and we are all capable of “memorizing” steps to a process. However, that same human side to us can be distracted – even momentarily –  which can be long enough to miss a step and potentially cause an error in the process.

- [ ] Consistency in process steps  
Whether it is a script for answering the telephone or a checklist for packaging a product to ship, having defined and ordered steps helps minimize or eliminate errors in the process.

- [ ] Reminders when distracted  
We are all human, and distractions are many and are ever-increasing with the fast pace with which we all live. Checklists can help safeguard against those momentarily lapses in focus or concentration.

- [ ] Working Document for Improvement  
Another advantage of using checklists is that they become a working improvement document. Use checklists and review them regularly to determine what works and what can be changed to improve the process. Use checklists as working documents that are modified, updated, and improved regularly.

- [ ] Contributes To Quality Services And Products  
Successful quality initiatives typically have some sort of work checklist incorporated into a standardized product or service process.

- [ ] Marketing tool – brag about what you do right!  
When organizations have good quality systems and processes, they should be used as a marketing tool to educate the public about what they do right and why their product or service will deliver quality to the customer. Being able to boast about a low error rate, great customer service, or a low product return rate is a great way to get customers interested in your product or service.

- [ ] Training Consistency  
Consistency is the name of the game when it comes to quality. Creating a standardized system and process that incorporates job checklists is one way to meet and exceed customer requirements and improve the bottom line.
