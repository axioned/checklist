description: We request the worklog from the team at the end of every day. So that, we can follow our performance (man/day) in each project and we call it "CRM". Follow the steps for the perfect CRM sharing!

## Start of the day

- [ ] Attend the daily project standup call

- [ ] Post the day's priorities on the project's Slack channel

## During the day

- [ ] Ask for help, now!
      Everyone, everyone in the team to proactively capture blockers, and specific details around blockers faced (so that others can try and help you asynchronously). Make this real-time, vs waiting till end of the day or next stand-up.

## End of the day

- [ ] Write down the end of the day status (before you log-off) of your issues like "Done", "In Progress"

- [ ] Push out the updates your work into a collaborative space
      Please push out commits, WIP pull requests, documents and/or designs into a collaborative space/cloud - Google Drive, GitHub, Figma etc.

- [ ] Update your time on [Tick (time-tracking tool)](https://axioned.tickspot.com/).
