# PRDXN Checklist

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/banuragprdxn/checklist) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/banuragprdxn/checklist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

We love to automate anything if it can be automated. For the things we canâ€™t automate (yet) we have a protocol. These protocols standardise our workflow so that everyone in PRDXN can work on a standard. Checklist is a project that helps us follow these protocols online.

## Motivation

We have been designing, developing & managing projects that vary in size for over 10 years now. Working on a different scale projects brought us some priceless experiences that led us to a greater success on the following projects. We updated our workflow, the way we work, even the hours we work. We try to adapt to the ongoing growth on technology and we are always on track with keeping our protocols updated.

This was an internal tool that we still use on every department but weâ€™ve decided to share this with the community so that we can help each other out, please feel free to suggest a checklist or an improvement on a checklist. We will consider every suggestion and implement the ones that we think fits our needs and the way we work.
